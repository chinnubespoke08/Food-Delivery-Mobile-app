# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

- We developing a React Native Expo Food app for Little Lemon restaurant.
- The app allows users to sign up and requires them to complete a registration process.
- Upon successful completion of the registration process, users are directed to a home screen.
- The home screen serves as the landing page and features a header, a banner with a search bar, and a list of    menu items that users can filter by category.
- The app also includes a Profile Screen where users can customize their name, email, photo, and other preferences.
- The Profile Screen includes four checkboxes for specific email notifications, such as order status, password changes, special offers, and newsletters.
- The app uses the AsyncStorage module to preserve user preferences even after the user quits the application.
- When the user clicks on the Logout button, the app redirects them back to the login page and clears all data saved from the Profile Screen.
- To populate, query, and filter menu items, the app uses a SQLite Database.
